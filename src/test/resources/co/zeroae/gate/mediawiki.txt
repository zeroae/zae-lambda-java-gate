'''''The Grand Budapest Hotel''''' is a 2014 [[comedy-drama]] film<!--CONSULT THE TALK PAGE before changing the genre. Your change WILL be reverted if you change it without discussion.--> written and directed by [[Wes Anderson]]. [[Ralph Fiennes]] leads a seventeen-actor [[ensemble cast]] as Monsieur Gustave H., famed [[concierge]] of a mountainside resort in the fictional country of Zubrowka. When Gustave is framed for the murder of a wealthy [[dowager]] ([[Tilda Swinton]]), he and his recently befriended protégé Zero ([[Tony Revolori]]) embark on a quest for fortune and a priceless [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] painting amidst the backdrop of an encroaching [[Fascism|fascist regime]]. Anderson's American Empirical Pictures produced the film in association with [[Studio Babelsberg]] and [[Indian Paintbrush (production company)|Indian Paintbrush]]'s [[Scott Rudin]] and [[Steven Rales]], and [[Fox Searchlight Pictures]] handled its commercial distribution. ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' was financed by Indian Paintbrush and a German government-funded rebate program.

Anderson and longtime collaborator [[Hugo Guinness]] conceived ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' as a fragmented tale following a character inspired by a mutual friend. They initially struggled to develop their idea further, but their experience touring Europe and researching the literature of Austrian novelist [[Stefan Zweig]] shaped their ambitions for the film. ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' draws visually from Europe-set mid-century Hollywood films and the [[Library of Congress]]'s [[photocrom]] print collection of alpine resorts. [[Principal photography]] took place in eastern Germany over a ten-week period from January to March 2013. French composer [[Alexandre Desplat]] composed the symphonic, [[Russian folk music|Russian folk]]-inspired score, which expanded on his early work with Anderson. The film explores themes of fascism, nostalgia, friendship, and loyalty. Further critical analysis has focused on the film's use of color as an important storytelling device.

''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' premiered in competition at the [[64th Berlin International Film Festival]] on February 6, 2014. The French theatrical release on February 26 preceded the film's global rollout, followed by releases in Germany, North America, and the United Kingdom on March 6–7. It received highly positive reviews for its craftsmanship, acting, and comedy; limited criticism was given to the film's approach to the subject matter. Professional rankings from [[BBC]] and [[IndieWire]], based on retrospective appraisal, cite ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' as one of the greatest films of the twenty-first century. The film earned US$172.9&nbsp;million in box office revenue worldwide, making it Anderson's highest grossing feature to date. It led the [[87th Academy Awards]] season with nine nominations (winning four), and earned several other honors chiefly for writing and technical achievement.

==Plot==
In a cemetery in the nation of Zubrowka,{{efn|Zubrowka is depicted as an [[alpine country]] located somewhere between Central and Eastern Europe. According to newspapers shown in the film, Zubrowka was a [[constitutional monarchy]] (the Empire of Zubrowka) at least until late 1932, when a neighboring fascist state annexed it during a period of war. In 1936 the country was liberated and by 1950 it had become a [[socialist republic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://imgur.com/gallery/ZDyFi/comment/1474868899|title=Newspapers & documents from "The Grand Budapest Hotel"|website=imgur.com|access-date=10 November 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lilianalambriev.com/work/the-grand-budapest-hotel|title=Chapter 5.

Written in 1985, it opens with his 1968 stay at the once-grand, now-drab hotel. There, he meets its owner, Zero Moustafa, who at dinner tells his [[rags to riches]] story.

In 1932, Zero is the newly hired lobby boy at the prestigious Grand Budapest Hotel. Monsieur Gustave H., the hotel's fastidious concierge, seduces old, wealthy clients—among them the 84-year-old [[dowager]] Madame D., with whom he has had a nearly two-decade affair.

Shortly after her last visit, Gustave learns from Zero that Madame D. has mysteriously died. He and Zero visit Schloss Lutz, her estate, to pay their respects and encounter her surviving relatives hearing the reading of her will by her attorney, Deputy Vilmos Kovacs. Kovacs announces a recent [[codicil (will)|codicil]] to the will which bequeathes ''[[Boy with Apple]]'', a priceless [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]] painting, to Gustave. Madame's son, Dmitri, is outraged and demands Gustave's arrest. Gustave and Zero leave, absconding with the painting for safekeeping.

At the Grand Budapest, Gustave is arrested for Madame D's murder. He befriends a gang during his imprisonment, who plot their escape. Gustave has Zero place digging tools inside pastries made by Agatha, an apprentice baker at Mendl's and Zero's girlfriend. Gustave and the others dig their way out and disperse. When Zero and Gustave are reunited, they set out to prove Gustave's innocence with the assistance of a fraternity of concierges: the Society of the Crossed Keys. Meanwhile, Dmitri's hired assassin J. G. Jopling kills Kovacs. He then kills Serge X, Madame's [[butler]], who before dying informed Gustave and Zero that Madame had a missing second will which will take effect only if she was murdered. With Jopling now targeting them, Gustave and Zero flee, prompting a long cat-and-mouse chase. Zero then pushes Jopling off a cliff to save Gustave, and the two men continue their escape from swarming Zubrowkan troops.

Gustave, Zero, and Agatha arrive back at the Grand Budapest to find it converted into a military headquarters. Agatha sneaks in to retrieve ''Boy with Apple'' to sell; as she tries to leave, Dmitri enters the hotel and spots her with the painting. Gustave and Zero rush to save Agatha from harm as she escapes from Dmitri. He opens fire on them, initiating a confusingly intense shootout with Zubrowkan troops. Agatha's attempt to escape leaves her and Zero hanging from a balcony before they fall, safely, into a van of pastries.

Madame's second will, making Gustave the beneficiary of her fortune, is found attached to the back of ''Boy with Apple''; he succeeds her as owner of the Grand Budapest Hotel, and becomes one of the wealthiest men in Zubrowka. While traveling by train, he, Zero, and Agatha encounter soldiers who destroy Zero's refugee documents. Gustave tries to fend off the soldiers but is shot dead. Zero, Gustave's sole heir, inherits his fortune; he retains the now-decrepit Grand Budapest in memory of Agatha, who died of illness with their infant son. The experiences are incorporated into ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'', which is read by the young girl earlier.

===Cinematography===

Yeoman shot ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' on [[35 mm movie film|35&nbsp;mm film]] using [[List of motion picture film stocks|Kodak Vision3 200T 5213]] film stock from a single [[Arricam|Arricam Studio]] camera provided by [[Arri]]'s Berlin office.<ref name=asc /> His approach entailed the use of a Chapman-Leonard Hybrid III [[camera dolly]] for [[tracking shot]]s and a [[geared head]] to achieve most of the film's rapid [[whip pan]]s. For whip pans greater than 90 degrees, the filmmakers installed a fluid head from [[Mitchell Camera|Mitchell Camera Corporation]]'s OConnor Ultimate product line for greater fidelity.<ref name=asc /> Anderson requested Yeoman and project [[key grip]] Sanjay Sami focus on new methods for shooting the scenes. Thus they used a towercam, a telescoping camera platform, to traverse between floors, sometimes in lieu of a [[crane shot|camera crane]]. For example, when a lantern drops to the basement from a hole in the cell floor in the Checkpoint Nineteen jailbreak scene, the filmmakers suspended the towercam upside-down, a setup which allowed the camera to descend to the ground.<ref name=asc />

''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' uses three [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratios]] as framing devices which streamline the film's story, evoking the aesthetic of the corresponding periods.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Laskin |first=Nicholas |url=https://www.indiewire.com/2015/09/watch-video-essay-explores-the-impact-of-different-aspect-ratios-in-film-260072/ |title=Watch: Video Essay Explores The Impact Of Different Aspect Ratios In Film |date=September 9, 2015 |work=IndieWire |access-date=November 15, 2019 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191115133510/https://www.indiewire.com/2015/09/watch-video-essay-explores-the-impact-of-different-aspect-ratios-in-film-260072/ |archive-date=November 15, 2019}}</ref><ref name="Seitz213">{{harvnb|Seitz|2015|p=213}}</ref> The multifarious structure of ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' emerged from Anderson's desire to shoot in 1.37:1 format, also known as [[Academy ratio]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://slate.com/culture/2014/03/grand-budapest-hotel-aspect-ratios-new-wes-anderson-movie-has-three-different-widths-here-s-why.html |title=The Aspect Ratios of The Grand Budapest Hotel |last1=Haglund |first1=David |last2=Harris |first2=Aisha |date=March 6, 2014 |website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191117002951/https://slate.com/culture/2014/03/grand-budapest-hotel-aspect-ratios-new-wes-anderson-movie-has-three-different-widths-here-s-why.html |archive-date=November 17, 2019 |access-date=November 16, 2019}}</ref> Production used Academy ratio for scenes set in 1932, which, according to Yeoman, provided the filmmakers with greater-than-routine headroom. He and the producers referred to the work of [[Ernst Lubitsch]] and other directors of the period to acclimate to the compositions produced from said format.<ref name=asc /> Filmmakers formatted modern scenes in standard 1.85:1 ratio, and the 1968 scenes were captured in widescreen 2.40:1 ratio with Technovision [[Cooke Optics|Cooke]] [[anamorphic format|anamorphic lens]]es. These lenses produced a certain texture, one that lacked the sharpness of [[Panavision]]'s Primo anamorphic lenses.<ref name=asc />

Yeoman lit interior shots with tungsten incandescent fixtures and [[DMX512|DMX]]-dimmer-controlled lighting. The crew made the Warenhaus ceiling from stretched [[muslin]] rigged with twenty 4K [[hydrargyrum medium-arc iodide lamp|HMI]] lamps, an arrangement wherein the reflected light penetrated the [[skylight]], accentuating the set's daylighting. Yeoman preferred the lighting choice because the warm tungsten fixtures contrasted with the coolish daylight.<ref name=asc /> When shooting deliberately less inviting hotel sets, such as Zero and Gustave's small bedrooms and the Grand Budapest's [[servants' quarters]], the filmmakers combined [[fluorescent lighting]], [[paper lantern]]s and bare [[incandescent lights]] for historical accuracy.<ref name=asc />

The [[Stuttgart]]-based LUXX Studios and [[Look Effects]]' German branch (also in Stuttgart) managed most of ''The Grand Budapest Hotel''{{'s}} visual effects, under the supervision of Gabriel Sanchez.<ref name=asc /><ref name=cgs /> Their work for the film comprised 300 shots, created by a small cadre of specialized artists.<ref name="cgs">{{Cite web |url=http://www.cgsociety.org/index.php/CGSFeatures/CGSFeatureSpecial/grand_budapest_hotel3 |title=The Grand Budapest Hotel |last=CGSociety staff |date=March 13, 2014 |website=CGSociety |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170509113357/http://www.cgsociety.org/index.php/CGSFeatures/CGSFeatureSpecial/grand_budapest_hotel3 |archive-date=May 9, 2017 |access-date=November 24, 2019}}</ref> The development of the film's effects was swift, but at times difficult. Sanchez did not work on set with Anderson as Look Effects opened their Stuttgart headquarters after ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' filming wrapped, and therefore was only able to reference his prior experience with the director. The California-based artist also became homesick working his first international assignment.<ref name=cgs /> Only four artists from the newly assembled team had experience of working on a multi-million dollar studio set.<ref name=cgs />

Creation of the effects was daunting because of their technical demands. The filmmakers camouflaged some of the [[stop motion animation|stop-motion]] and matte effects in the forest-set chase scene to convey the desired intensity, and enhancing the snowscape with particle effects posed another challenge.<ref name=cgs /> Sanchez cites the observatory and hotel shots as work that best demonstrate his special effects team's ingenuity. To achieve the aging brutalist design of the 1968 Grand Budapest, they generated computer models supplemented with detailed lighting, matte effects and shadowy expanses.<ref name=cgs /> The crew used a similar technique in developing digital shots of the observatory; unlike the hotel, the observatory's base miniature was presented in pieces. They rendered the observatory with 20 different elements, data furthermore enhanced at Anderson's request. It took about one hour per shot to complete the final digital rendering.<ref name=cgs />

===Set design===

[[Adam Stockhausen]]—another Anderson associate—was responsible for ''The Grand Budapest Hotel''{{'s}} production design. He and Anderson collaborated previously on ''[[The Darjeeling Limited]]'' (2007) and ''Moonrise Kingdom''.<ref name="Seitz151">{{harvnb|Seitz|2015|p=151}}</ref> Stockhausen researched the [[Library of Congress]]'s [[photocrom]] print collection of [[alps|alpine]] resorts to source ideas for the film's visual palette. These images showcased little of recognizable Europe, instead cataloging obscure historical landmarks unknown to the general public.<ref name="vice1">{{Cite web |url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/78exvx/the-grand-budapest-hotel-production-designer |title=We Talked to 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' Production Designer About Pastries, Postcards, and Taxidermy |last=Chung |first=Becky |date=February 9, 2015 |website=[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]] |access-date=September 29, 2019}}</ref><ref name="Seitz163">{{harvnb|Seitz|2015|p=163}}</ref> The resulting stylistic choice is a warm, bright visual palette pronounced by soft pastel tonalities. Some of ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' interior sets contrast this look in interior shots, primarily Schloss Lutz and the Checkpoint Nineteen prison: the imposing hardwoods, intense greens and golds of the Schloss Lutz evoke oppressive wealth, and the derelict Checkpoint Nineteen decays in a cool bluish-gray tint.<ref name=Seitz143 />

The filmmakers relied on [[matte (filmmaking)|matte paintings]] and [[miniature effect]] techniques to play on perspective for elaborate scenes, creating the illusion of size and grandeur. Under the leadership of Simon Weisse, scale models of structures were constructed by a Berlin-based propmaking team at Studio Babelsberg in tandem with the Görlitz shoot.<ref name="Cinefex">{{Cite web |url=https://cinefex.com/blog/the-grand-budapest-hotel/ |title=The Grand Budapest Hotel |last=Edwards |first=Graham |date=March 11, 2014 |website=Cinefex |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20150218233732/http://cinefex.com/blog/the-grand-budapest-hotel/ |archive-date=February 18, 2015 |access-date=September 29, 2019}}</ref><ref name=NYT022814 /> Weisse joined ''The Grand Budapest Hotel''{{'s}} design staff after coming to the attention of production manager Miki Emmrich, with whom he worked on ''[[Cloud Atlas (film)|Cloud Atlas]]'' (2012).<ref name=Cinefex /> Anderson liked the novelty of miniatures, having used them in ''[[The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou]]'' (2004) and more extensively in ''[[Fantastic Mr. Fox (film)|Fantastic Mr. Fox]]'' (2009).<ref name="NYT022814">{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/02/movies/the-miniature-model-behind-the-grand-budapest-hotel.html |title=You Can Look, but You Can't Check In |last=Murphy |first=Mekado |date=February 28, 2014 |website=The New York Times |access-date=March 14, 2014}}</ref>

Indeed, Zero appears to be Gustave's only true friend, and his unwavering devotion (at first, a mentor-protégé relationship) establishes the film's strongest bond.<ref name=queen /><ref name="offscreen">{{Cite magazine |last=Garrett |first=Daniel |date=November 2016 |title=Charm, Courage, and Eruptions of Vulgar Force: Wes Anderson's The Grand Budapest Hotel |magazine=Offscreen |language=en |location=Canada |volume=20 |issn=1712-9559 }}</ref> Gustave is underwhelmed by Zero but is increasingly empathetic to his newly hired mentee's plight in their subsequent exploits, united by their shared enthusiasm for the hotel, so much that he defends Zero against police thuggery and rewards his loyalty with his inheritance.<ref name="queen">{{Cite magazine |last=Marshall |first=Lee |date=Summer 2014 |title=The Budapest Hotel: Wes Anderson's Fabulous Fancy |magazine=[[Queen's Quarterly]] |language=en |location=Kingston, Ontario |volume=121 |pages=242–251 }}</ref><ref name="nyer">{{Cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/the-grand-budapest-hotel-wes-andersons-artistic-manifesto |title="The Grand Budapest Hotel": Wes Anderson's Artistic Manifesto |last=Brody |first=Richard |date=March 7, 2014 |website=The New Yorker |access-date=March 1, 2020}}</ref> Zero's less-central romance with Agatha is as constant a presence as his friendship with Gustave; he continues operating the hotel in his dead lover's memory, despite the slain Gustave representing the Grand Budapest's spirit.<ref name=queen /> The subject matter's emphasis of love, friendship, and the intertwining tales of nobility, dignity and self-control, ''[[The New Yorker]]''{{'s}} [[Richard Brody]] argues, forms the "very soul of a moral politics that transcends accidents of circumstance and particular historical incidents".<ref name=nyer />

Kornhaber contends the focus on the dynamic of a mismatched pairing forms the crux of ''The Grand Budapest Hotel''{{'s}} central theme.<ref name="Kornhaber2356"/> The unusual circumstance of the Gustave–Zero friendship seems to reflect an attachment to "an idea of historical and cultural belonging that they find ultimately to be best expressed through one another", and by proxy, the two men discover a fundamental kinship through their shared esteem of the Grand Budapest.<ref name="Kornhaber2356">{{harvnb|Kornhaber|2017|pp=253–254}}</ref>

===Color===

''The Grand Budapest Hotel''{{'s}} use of color accentuates narrative tones and conveys visual emphasis to the subject matter and passage of time. The film eschews Anderson's trademark pale yellow for a sharp palette of vibrant reds, pinks and purples in prewar Grand Budapest scenes. The composition fades as the timeline forebodes impending war, sometimes in complete black-and-white in scenes exploring Zero's memory of wartime, underscoring the gradual tonal shift. Subdued beiges, orange, and pale blue characterize the visual palette of postwar Grand Budapest scenes, manifesting the hotel's diminished prestige.<ref name=queen /> Lighting underscores emotional cues in key scenes which revisit Zero's history; for example, when the film explores memories of the deceased Agatha, the overhead lighting dims in a medium-distance [[two shot]] and creates a [[chiaroscuro]] effect.<ref name="medium">{{Cite web |url=https://medium.com/@davidleeds/beauty-at-a-distance-cinematic-techniques-of-the-grand-budapest-hotel-1a738924cf62 |title=Beauty at a Distance: Cinematic Techniques of 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' |last=Leeds |first=David |date=August 18, 2017 |website=[[Medium (website)|Medium]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20190915051557/https://medium.com/@davidleeds/beauty-at-a-distance-cinematic-techniques-of-the-grand-budapest-hotel-1a738924cf62 |archive-date=September 15, 2019 |access-date=September 15, 2019}}</ref>

''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' was not an immediate favorite to dominate the 87th Academy Awards season. The film's early March opening was thought to deter any chance of Oscar recognition, since the usual industry practice to better position feature films for awards attention is to schedule a fall release.<ref name=varietyoscars /><ref name=Deadoscars /> The last spring season releases to achieve Best Picture success until then were ''[[Erin Brockovich (film)|Erin Brockovich]]'' (2000) and ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|The Silence of the Lambs]]'' (1991).<ref name=Deadoscars /> As the Academy Award nominations approached, a frontrunner had not emerged, partly as a result of a critical backlash against the season's biggest contenders, such as ''[[American Sniper]]'', ''[[Selma (film)|Selma]]'' and ''[[The Imitation Game]]''.<ref name="Deadoscars">{{Cite web |url=https://deadline.com/2015/01/oscars-grand-budapest-hotel-awards-1201339759/ |title=Oscars: How 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' Could Turn Awards Season On Its Head |last=Hammond |first=Pete |date=January 2, 2015 |website=Deadline |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200325015244/https://deadline.com/2015/01/oscars-grand-budapest-hotel-awards-1201339759/ |archive-date=March 25, 2020 |access-date=March 24, 2020}}</ref> But US critics spread their honors for ''The Grand Budapest Hotel'' when compiling their end-of-year lists, and the film soon gained momentum thanks to a significant presence in the award circuit.<ref name=Deadoscars /> Fox Searchlight president Nancy Utley attributed the film's ascendancy to its months-long presence on multi-media home entertainment platforms, which provided greater viewing opportunity for Academy voters.<ref name="varietyoscars">{{Cite news |last=Lang |first=Brent |url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/how-grand-budapest-hotel-became-a-surprise-oscars-powerhouse-1201406400/ |title=How 'Grand Budapest Hotel' Became a Surprise Oscars Powerhouse |date=January 15, 2015 |work=Variety |access-date=March 24, 2020 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200325022104/https://variety.com/2015/film/news/how-grand-budapest-hotel-became-a-surprise-oscars-powerhouse-1201406400/ |archive-date=March 25, 2020}}</ref> It led the Academy Award season with nine nominations (including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]] and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]]), tied with ''[[Birdman (film)|Birdman]]''.<ref name=varietyoscars /><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-birdman-grand-budapest-hotel-764014 |title=Oscars: 'Birdman' and 'The Grand Budapest Hotel' Make a Stylish Statement |last=Kilday |first=Gregg |date=January 15, 2015 |website=The Hollywood Reporter |url-status=live |archive-url=https://archive.today/20200325031504/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-birdman-grand-budapest-hotel-764014 |archive-date=March 25, 2020 |access-date=March 24, 2020}}</ref> The film received four Oscars: [[Academy Award for Best Original Score|Best Original Score]], [[Academy Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]], [[Academy Award for Best Makeup and Hairstyling|Best Makeup and Hairstyling]], and [[Academy Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2015 |title=The 87th Academy Awards (2015) Nominees and Winners |work=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] |access-date=February 23, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150223171100/http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/2015 |archive-date=February 23, 2015}}</ref>
